This email newsletter was created as part of an assignment for my 6-week Virtual Assistant Course at SGB. I designed the template using Mailchimp and wrote the copy using a curiosity-driven style to attract potential clients, particularly professional women, mompreneurs, and women leaders who balance their careers and personal lives.

The purpose of this newsletter was to increase email open rates and enhance conversion performance through engaging subject lines and thoughtful content design.
